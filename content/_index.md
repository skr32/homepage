I'm Sascha Krusbersky, a student at MCI in Innsbruck, pursuing a bachelor's degree in "Management Communication & IT." My journey spans both Germany and the USA, offering diverse IT perspectives. As an IT consultant, I've honed my skills collaborating with global teams. Today, I'm engaged in freelancing within the Unified Endpoint Management field, while also maintaining a keen interest in continually exploring the latest IT advancements. My experiences in both countries have given me a unique global insight into technology. I'm driven by a passion for staying at the cutting edge of innovation in an environment that fosters strong relationships. Welcome to my journey!
